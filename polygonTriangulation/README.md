# Polygon Triangulation
> An implementation of the ear-clipping algorithm for triangulating a polygon.

 This is an implementation of the Ear-Clipping algorithm to find a trinagulation of a polygon. The algorithm runs in `O(nÂ²)`, where `n` is the number of points that define the polygon. The underlying structure used to facilitate the algorithm is a circular doubly linked list, that is used to represent the polygon's border.

 Visualization is generated with GTK and Cairo.
